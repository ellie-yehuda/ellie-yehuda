## 🚀 Projects

**[Restaurant Recommendation System](https://github.com/ellie-yehuda/rec-system)**  
End-to-end system for personalized restaurant picks. I built a Python crawler to collect real TripAdvisor reviews, stored and queried data with MongoDB, and developed clustering and sentiment analytics to power recommendations.

**[MoodMate](https://github.com/ellie-yehuda/moodmate)**  
A mental-wellness chat companion running on FastAPI and Together.ai’s LLM. I integrated LangChain’s conversational memory to enable context-aware, supportive chats that nudge users toward healthy habits. 

**[Guaco](https://github.com/ellie-yehuda/guaco)**  
A gamified nutrition tracker that makes healthy eating fun. I designed the React/TypeScript UI (using shadcn/ui & Tailwind), implemented browser-based local storage for offline persistence, and created Python FastAPI microservices that use the OpenAI API to generate recipes and meal plans.
